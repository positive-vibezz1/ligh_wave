### what is it
to simple programs in which tkinter uses the microphone to make "a light show" and show u how loud the music is(not calibrated, do not use for proffesional use) both programs are multithreaded.
the program needs to be optimezed to react quicker to the sound.

#### second program
the second program uses pyaudio and librosa to process the audio and then uses tkinter to create objects which then react to the music

### content

i made the program more scalable, i think
